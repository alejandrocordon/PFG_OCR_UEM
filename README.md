Biomedical concept searcher Android App for Gyngerbread. Based in tess-two, Leptonica and Mezzofanti projects.


This project has developed a tool to be used in mobile devices, which shows additional information to the user  in real time, about biomedical concepts, from a mobile picture  with the biomedical text.

Project Scope:
The proposal solution implement a computer system which runs over Android operative systems. 


The application is implemented with Java, and It is used the Software Development Kit (SDK) for Java, supplied by Android, plus Eclipse development environment with ADT plugin (Android Development Tools) , which is  developed by Google for integrating SDK into Eclipse, therefore Android programs can be developed from Eclipse. 

The methodology followed for every life cycle stages  has been The Rational Unified Process(RUP) which is an iterative software development process framework.

And the life cycle has been Extreme Programming (XP), which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements, advocating frequent releases in short development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints where new customer requirements can be adopted.
